DESCRIPTION:
In this project, we utilized several powerful tools and libraries to build and visualize a Decision Tree classifier for a classification task using the Python programming language. Python is widely adopted in data science and machine learning due to its simplicity, extensive community support, and robust ecosystem of libraries. One of the core libraries used was Scikit-learn (also known as sklearn), which offers a comprehensive suite of machine learning algorithms, including the DecisionTreeClassifier, which was central to this task. To manipulate and explore the dataset effectively, we used Pandas, a library that provides easy-to-use data structures like DataFrames, which are essential for handling tabular data. For visualization, we employed Matplotlib and Seaborn. Matplotlib's plot_tree function allowed us to create a graphical representation of the decision tree, which is useful for understanding the decision paths and splits in the model. Seaborn, built on Matplotlib, was used to generate a heatmap of the confusion matrix, giving a clear visual of the model's prediction accuracy across different classes. NumPy, another foundational library, supported efficient numerical operations, although it primarily worked behind the scenes as a dependency for Pandas and Scikit-learn.

The entire workflow was implemented in a Jupyter Notebook environment. Jupyter Notebooks are interactive, browser-based platforms widely used in the data science community for their ability to combine live code execution with explanatory text, equations, and visualizations. This makes it an ideal tool for machine learning tasks, especially during the exploratory and prototyping phases. The notebook format also encourages documentation and reproducibility, allowing others to follow the step-by-step process of data preprocessing, model training, visualization, and evaluation. Alternatively, tools like Google Colab (a cloud-hosted Jupyter Notebook environment), VS Code, or PyCharm can also be used for similar tasks depending on user preference and project requirements
